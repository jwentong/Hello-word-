# Hello-word-
Just another repository


Recently, I received a samll project about wireless communication systems and then I am suggested to work on GitHub.
This small project is about to set up a wireless communication system using multi-carrier modulation technogly.
So I would like to adopt OFDM technogy to finish this project.
Finally, the USRP N210 and GNU-Radio can be implenmented to set up a real OFDM communication system.
I have the following list of equipment:
USRP N210 X4
dell computers core i5   x4

The problem is that I am a second grade graduate student and I have no exprience to do this,
Thus I look forward someboby can work together with me.
